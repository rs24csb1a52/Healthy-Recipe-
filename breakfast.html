    <p>And just like that, it’s back-to-school time! I’m lining up the fall recipe calendar, getting ready to test, shoot, and share a slew of new ideas. For us, this season will be busy, and I know that it will be for many of you too. Today, I’m sharing my favorite healthy breakfast ideas to get these jam-packed days off to a great start. You’ll find ones that are perfect for making ahead and taking on the go, ones that are quick and easy to whip up in the morning, and even a few for days when you have a bit more time to linger over breakfast.</p>
